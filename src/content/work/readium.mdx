Readium was a project I started with a my friend [Kyler](https://www.kyler.design/) during COVID. The aim was to create a book tracking app that was more human-friendly than Goodreads. We wanted to make it easy to track what you read, and to share that with friends. We also wanted to make it easy to find new books to read, and to get recommendations from friends.

We launched a beta but never marketed out to a wider audience. Sadly, other commitments got in the way and we ended up parking the project.

Nevertheless, it was a fantastic work experience, full of learnings and lessons about 
building an app. Our stack was [React](https://react.dev/) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) for the backend. The app was hosted on Vercel.

We also used a wide range of other tech: [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics, [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product)
for documentation, [Linear](https://linear.app/) for project management, [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for design and [Discord](https://discord.com/) for communication just to name the key ones.
