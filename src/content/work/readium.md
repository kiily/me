Readium was a project I started with a my friend [Kyler](https://www.kyler.design/) during COVID. The aim was to create a book tracking app that was more human-friendly than Goodreads. We wanted to make it easy to track what you read, and to share that with friends. We also wanted to make it easy to find new books to read, and to get recommendations from friends.

We launched a beta but never marketed out to a wider audience. Sadly, other commitments got in the way and we ended up parking the project.

Nevertheless, it was a fantastic work experience, full of learnings and lessons about building an app. Our stack was React with Typescript using Next.js. Tailwind for styling and hasura for the backend. The app was hosted on Vercel.

We also used a wide range of other tech: plausible for analytics, Notion for documentation, Linear for project management, Figma for design and Discord for communication just to name the key ones.
