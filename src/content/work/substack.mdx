I publish some of my creative writing in a Substack newsletter. You can subscribe to it [**here**](https://kiily.substack.com/).

I started writing more frequently on tube journeys to work in 2019 and eventually started doing morning pages.
The more I wrote, the more I enjoyed it. It's become more of a habit now and while I am
not sure exactly where I am taking this, it feels great to get my thoughts out there.

I have been writing in English more consistently in recent times but you'll also find 
some content in other languages.

Below are some of the more recent pieces:


# [Have you ever seen a tree?](https://kiily.substack.com/p/have-you-ever-seen-a-tree)
# [An act of balance](https://kiily.substack.com/p/an-act-of-balance)
