## FLOWN

I am the Lead Developer at [**FLOWN**](https://flown.com?referral=miguel-marinvermelho-9f20e). FLOWN brings focus and flow to those battling 
distraction and isolation.

FLOWN is a ‘Twitch for work’, where our inspiring Facilitators help people focus, 
feel accountable, and achieve flow states at work. 

With so many online and offline distractions, we are eroding our ability to focus 
at work, and the move to remote work driven by COVID has meant people have lost the workplace rituals and human connection that provided accountability, novelty, and meaning.

Using the science behind deep work and flow states, FLOWN has created a platform 
offering a range of different virtual co-working, body doubling, and creativity 
boosting experiences to suit any type of knowledge worker. Whether you are a freelancer 
preparing business proposals, an entrepreneur designing a new strategy, a PhD student 
writing their thesis, or someone with ADHD needing focus to help them work more 
effectively, FLOWN has a live or on-demand experience to help them transform their 
relationship with work.

FLOWN is led by serial entrepreneur Alicia Navarro, who founded content monetization 
platform Skimlinks (acquired by Connexity April 2021) and was Chair of proptech platform 
Yourkeys (acquired by Zoopla June 2021).
