				<div class="content flex flex-col gap-3">
					<p>
						I am a software engineer with a passion for building products and
						all things productivity.
					</p>
					<p>
						I live in London and currently work @FLOWN as the lead developer.
						FLOWN is focused on helping people work better and feel good doing
						it.
					</p>
					<p>
						I tend to dabble in a few things (sometimes too many for my own
						good...) and have a few passing interests; currently, I am doing
						some creative writing, researching cryptocurrencies, learning
						Japanese, and trying to learn how to do some basic 3D printing.
						(some are going a lot better than others 🙃).
					</p>
					<p>Oh, and Web3, maybe, not sure...</p>
					<p>And, of course, I love to spend time coding.</p>

				<h2 class="section-title">Writing</h2>
				<div class="content flex flex-col gap-3">
					<p>
						I write when I am bored or when I feel like offloading thoughts onto
						paper (or screen I suppose)... Please do show these some love if you
						like the content as it will go a long way to push me to do more.
					</p>
					<p>
						Recently, I have been thinking a lot about the concept of <a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81"
							>Śūnyatā</a
						> and how fascinating it is. Understanding it has been the most transformative
						experience that I have ever had.

				<h2 class="section-title">Languages</h2>
				<div class="content flex flex-col gap-3">
					<p>
						I grew up speaking three languages and having to learn them all in
						and outside of school. This made me particularly enjoy languages
						themselves, how they work and how they came about.
					</p>
					<p>I am fluent in 🇵🇹 🇪🇸 🇫🇷 🇬🇧 and my 🇮🇹 needs improvement</p>
					<p>Basic: 🇩🇪 🇱🇺</p>
					<p>Learning: 🇯🇵 🇮🇷</p>
